First, you need to unregister the problematic device from Azure AD.

Launch Command Prompt on the computer you want to unregister and run the dsregcmd /leave command.
Make sure to delete the MS-Organization-Access and MS-Organization-P2P-Access entries from the certificate store.
Run the dsregcmd /status command, and make sure AzureAdJoined is set to No.
After that, you need to register the problematic machine using Hybrid Azure AD Join.

dsregcmd /leave

dsregcmd /status
