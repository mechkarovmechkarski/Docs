This was achieved by creating a registry binary key called
"Scancode Map" 
in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout.

The next step was to modify its data, which I did by typing this:

00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
02 00 00 00 34 00 53 00
00 00 00 00

After rebooting, the NumPad dot acted as an ordinary dot.
