Guide for VMWARE ESXi how to copy VM

1. Log to VMWARE ESXi host

2. Go to Storage -> SATA-DataStore-01 (or other) -> Datastore browser -> Create directory (with the name of the new VM, for example new_VM_name)

3. Copy *.vmdk & *.vmx files from template_folder to new_VM_name folder

4. Open SSH connection to the VMWARE ESXi host
username: domain\domain_account

	4.1.	(If connection refused error!) Go to VMWARE ESXi host GUI -> Host -> Manage -> Services -> Start TSM-SSH service

5.SSH commands to the ESXi host:
	5.1.	cd vmfs/volumes/SATA-DataStore-01/new_VM

	5.2.	vmkfstools -E "old_VM_name.vmdk" "new_VM_name.vmdk"

	5.3.	cp "old_VM_name.vmx" "new_VM_name.vmx"

	5.4.	vi "new_VM_name.vmx"
		to edit press: 'a'
		to save and quit press: 'esc' and then: ':wq'

	5.5.	Within the configuration file, modify all old instances of the virtual machine's file names to the new file names. At a minimum, modify these values (more may exist):

		nvram = " newname.nvram"
		displayName = " newname "
		extendedConfigFile = " newname .vmxf"
		scsi0:0.fileName = " newname .vmdk"
		[...]
		migrate.hostlog = "./ newname -UUID.hlog"

		Repeat this process for each virtual machine disk. For example:

		scsi0:1.fileName = " newname _1.vmdk"
		scsi0:2.fileName = " newname _2.vmdk"

		Correct the VMkernel swap file reference.

		For example:

		sched.swap.derivedName = "/vmfs/volumes/DatastoreUUID/ newname/ newname-UUID.vswp

		Note: Ensure that you rename both the .vswp file and the directory name for the swap file in bold.

6. Delete old *.vmx file

7. Register *.vmx with right click the *.vmx file from GUI -> Register VM

8. It asks did you MOVED or COPIED the machine. Select that you COPIED it.
